Hello world,

What would be a better start than to discuss my investment strategy?

This strategy has been influenced by talking to friends and reading a variety of investment books, most notably Ben Graham's "The intelligent investor". This is a fantastic book about investing, and has influenced such great professionals as Warren Buffet.

In short, I take a long-term, buy-and-hold strategy. I emphasize starting to invest early, living below my means, diversification, simplicity, and sticking to my investment plan "regardless" of market conditions. (I will soon dedicate an separate article about why!).

Over the longrun, I expect to achieve returns of 6-8% on the stock market and invest very little time (I am no professional investor, although finance is so much fun!). 



## Investment objectives and constraints

### Time horizon: Fundamentally "Longterm, but..."
- Not indefinitely: 30 years to retirement (simple assumption for now!), 60 years to expected end of life
- This asset allocation and investment plan is for an inexact, ~5 year horizon and may be revised then, because things can change:
     > changes in income
     > business formation
     > relocation to other jurisdiction
     > home purchase, family
     > external changes, e.g., drastic tax code changes
     > availability of new financial instruments, e.g. great new types of Vanguard funds
- Sequence-of-returns risk therefore matters, unlimited volatility is undesirable

- Risk preference
  -- As a consequence of the above time horizon, the historical volatility of the total stock market (up to 10-20 year stretches of negative returns) is objectively excessive for my situation
  -- Also subjectively, the psychological burden of decades of underperformance exceeds to me the psychological burden of dealing with a moderately complex portfolio (3-6 funds) that has lower volatility and historically shorter periods of negative returns
  -- Nonetheless, given these constraints, maximize equity exposure to participate in growth 
  -- Also must hedge against non-market personal financial exposure:
     > as a renter, I want to hedge this liability by an overweighted position in REITs
     > I want to hedge my personal and professional commitment to the US by overweighting non-US markets

* Performance targets and criteria
  - manageable complexity
  - volatility 1972-present less than 12% (compared to 18% for total US stock market)
  - average annual real returns 1972-present at least 6-8% (vs. 7.5% for total stock market)
  - longest drawdown < 5 yrs (vs. 13 yrs for US total stock mkt)
  - finally, both to limit complexity and to for professional reasons, no active investing and no individual stocks at this time


Asset allocation, fund selection, and fund placement
====================================================

Basic allocation 
----------------
  70% equities for gains
  15% fixed income for stability and liquidity (not as liquid as cash, but can be liquidated reasonably if needed)
  15% cash equivalents for liquidity / rebalancing on market dips / opportunistic investment (e.g. home purchase downpayment, business formation)


Cash and fixed income investment
--------------------------------

  * in current environment, bonds are unattractive
      - short term bonds have yields ~ savings account  (1 yr treasuries: 0.7% vs 1% MM acc; 5 yr treasuries: 1.4% vs 1.9% 5 yr CD at Capital One)
      - long term bonds lock me into longterm low yields
      - bond funds will lose value if rates rise
  
  * Put cash in money market account at 1% and put fixed income allocation into 5-year CDs with 1.9% yield and 6 mo. early withdrawal penalty - can easily reinvest at higher yields if appropriate


Equity allocation
-----------------

  * Intellectual starting point: "Own the market".  Approximate as VT / Total World.

  * However, want to tilt away from that core holding for several reasons:
    - Market cap weighting is biased toward highly financialized, highly valued sectors of the world economy
    - It overrepresents US companies (55% of VT, vs. 16% US share of world GDP) -- yes, many sell internationally, but so do Chinese- or EU-based companies; it's still an overweight due to the fact that Saudi Aramco, much of China, etc. is simply not publicly traded
    - Within the US, it underrepresents sectors of GDP and of total assets that are less likely to be large public companies; e.g. share of REITs in VTI ~ 2%, RE spending as share of GDP ~ 15-20%.
    - Especially with DCA and rebalancing, having fixed allocations (as opposed to market cap-driven drift) to several uncorrelated asset classes improves returns and volatility
    - Can overweight certain asset classes that provide a hedge against individual financial dependencies
      > as a renter, overweight REITs (and reduce this exposure when/if buying a home)
      > as a consultant to large corporates, overweight small caps
      > being based in the US, overweight ex-US
    - Can overweight individually volatile but collectively diversified asset classes with expected returns > S&P500:
      > overweight emerging markets, in a secular bet on the Great Rebalancing
      > overweight small-cap value stocks, for higher returns at the price of higher volatility and lower liquidity
    - opportunities for tax loss harvesting

  * There are good reasons to limit the extent of diversification / tilting
    - having multiple assets invites bad psychology - e.g. overweighting recent overperformers, market timing, etc.
    - need to rebalance can initially be satisfied from new savings, but ultimately may require tax-inefficient selling
    - complexity is a time sink, and one might overlook changes within funds
    - complexity can grow over a lifetime as 401k are rolled over, new funds are added as they become available, etc
    - It may simply be unnecessary -- the lower volatility may not matter on long-enough time scales, and the expected returns won't exceed VT (much)

  * Balancing these competing considerations, a final (simple) allocation to diverse asset classes using Vanguard ETFs:

    15%   cash / MM
    15%   fixed income / CDs
    ------------
    25%	  VT (total market, ~50-60% US, 20-30% developed ex-US)
    15%   VBR (small-cap value)
    15%   VWO (emerging mkts)
    15%   VNQ (commercial REITs)
    ------------

   * Investing schedule:
     - auto-invest monthly
     - rebalance annually with bonus + spare cash; avoid selling to rebalance
     - rebalance if bands are left: 15% = 10-20% band, 25% = 17.5-32.5% band
     - rebalance to target allocation

   * Fund placement:
     - will have 18k my contribution + 8k employer contribution = 26k 401(k) with Vanguard
     - assume 74k annual contribution to taxable investment account
     - Dividend yields and interest rates:
       CDs  1.90%
       VT   1.53%
       VBR  1.40%
       VWO  0.68%
       VNQ  4.34%
     - Place VNQ (15k p.a.) in 401k
     - VT not available in my 401k
     - Place VBR partially in 401k (~11k) - can sell off tax-free to rebalance if needed; expect this to have high average returns
     - In the future, if/when I add a bond fund, it will go into 401k instead of VBR

  * Reasonable things that I will NOT do
    - automatic frequent tax loss harvesting a la Wealthfront
      > messy complexity for tax purposes
      > messy complexity if/when I want to consolidate / transfer / analyze my holdings
    - Gold
      > could be used as another uncorrelated asset class to improve returns and volatility -- borne out by backtesting, e.g. Permanent Portfolio or Golden Butterfly
      > still SEEN by enough people as a form of money and safe haven to have great runs, e.g. 1970s and 2000s
      > But: not a productive asset, expected real return is zero
      > High degree of speculation makes it hard to reason about gold
    - Finer-grained allocations by geography, size, term, etc (e.g. Asian small cap value, European bonds, etc)
      > too much complexity, too much of a time sink
